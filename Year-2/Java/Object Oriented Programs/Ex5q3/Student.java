Purpose: Q3. Complete all of the exercises in question 1 for a class Student that you will now create with six 
		 attributes (attributes such as name address, course etc.).  For the final part, create a calculate registration 
		 fee method instead of the taxPayable() method where a student pays a flat registration fee of €500 with a levy
		of €100 for each year of the course that they have completed, i.e. first years pay €500, second years pay €600 etc.
